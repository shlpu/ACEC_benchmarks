USAGE: ./spectrum-AIG *.blif/aig/v/bench
        Supports .v .blif .aig .bench files
        Generate the spectrum of multipliers.
SCRIPT:
./getResult.sh >> log => This will give you the runtime results of constructing the spectra of all the multipliers in the dir.
If you want to check the spectrum of each multiplier, delete grep code in the script file.

BENCHMARKS:
\benchmark_date2018:
	a) bp-xx-xx, sp-xx-xx are AOKI multipliers originally developed by authors in [1], used for evaluation in [2][3].
	b) mult-abc-xx are generated with ABC using "gen -N -m" commmand.
	c) mult-abc-Booth-xx are generated with ABC using "%blast -b" command.
	d) btor-xx are multipliers synthesized by Boolector, provided in [3].
