## This repo includes a collection of arithmetic multiplier benchmarks. 
These benchmarks have been used in the recent works of formal verification of arithmetic circuits. 
Please contact Cunxi Yu (cunxi.yu@epfl.ch) if you have questions or bugs.

BENCHMARKS:
\benchmark:
	a) bp-xx-xx, sp-xx-xx are AOKI multipliers originally developed by authors in [1], used for evaluation in [2][3][5][6].
		bp: booth partial products
		wt: wallace-tree
		cl: carry-look-ahead
		rc: ripple carry
		..(for details see [1][2])
	b) mult-abc-xx are generated with ABC using "gen -N -m" commmand used in [4][5]
	c) mult-abc-Booth-xx are generated with ABC using "%blast -b" command, used in [5].
	d) btor-xx are multipliers synthesized by Boolector, provided in [6].

Notes:
XX-dc2: optimized by "dc2" flow by ABC.
XX-resyn3: optimized by "resyn3" flow by ABC.
